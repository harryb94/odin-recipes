        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Some recipes should be kept simple as nature intended them to be, and in my opinion, <em>Pumpkin Soup</em> is one of those dishes.<br>
            The natural flavour of pumpkin is good enough that you need very little to make a beautiful, creamy, full flavoured soup.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
